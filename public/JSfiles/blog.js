        content:'We are all busy in our modern day lives, so busy, that we end up disturbing our work-life balance. It is quite easy to put all our focus on work and building our careers. Obviously, who doesn’t want it! Everyone wishes to remain busy in our lives, but, on cost of our work-life balance? It is important to make a perfect balance between your work and life.  One of the most efficient ways to keep our work-life balanced is taking up a HOBBY. HOBBY is considered to be a regular activity that provide us with enjoyment, leisure and peace in different ways. It is the best way to reduce stress of everyday life. Our HOBBY becomes our own personal escape from the real world. It helps us seek pleasure and relaxation in a life full of rush. It not only makes us more interesting but also helps us calm down at certain stages of our life. It increases our patience level to tough situations.  If you are an Introvert, it is an easy way to connect people and increase your network. For Extroverts and Ambiverts it helps them meet different kinds of people and make some cool Introvert friends with similar field of interest. Some people lack self confidence and self-esteem, because of weird social pressure. They often forget that different people have different hidden talents. So, finding ourselves a HOBBY often helps us to find our hidden talent and hence increasing our self-esteem and self confidence. In such times, where isolating ourselves from the world has become our topmost priority, it is important to keep ourselves out of boredom and not fall into the prey of depression. Exploring new areas of interest and developing new skills not only helps us eradicate boredom, but also helps us gain knowledge about different areas of interest. After, a month or so, we can notice changes in our thinking capacity. We will be able to see situations with new perspective and take better decision which eventually makes us a better human being. Nowadays, it’s very easy to indulge bad habits in our life. HOBBIES prevent us from wasting our time and thus preventing us from bad habits. It is always said, “Idle hands are Devil’s playthings.” When we get hooked to our HOBBY, we will realise they become integral part of our lives, thus, pushing us taking required amount of regular breaks from work. We often hear people around us complaining how monotonous our lives become after a point. Spending time doing an enjoyable activity that is not attached to work or other commitments will help increase our happiness and gain back the lost satisfaction with life.Sometimes, when life ends up in crisis and it doesn’t go along as we planned it, these HOBBIES help us get additional income. This additional income helps us to cope up with the crisis. We often tend to zone out from a conversation or even get stuck in our past or busy in thoughts of future. HOBBIES help us staying in present and keep our mind occupied, thus, reducing chances of zoning out. Often, therapists advice their patients to spend more time doing their HOBBY to fight off depression and it has successfully helped in warding off depression or anxiety. At the end of the day, when we go to our beds with the satisfaction of being productive throughout the day, it leads to better sleep. Spending time with our friends, family and loved ones doing things we love, helps strengthening the relationship over the period of time and create some memories which can be cherished forever. Finally, if you want another positive way to improve your life, give it a try, learn and challenge yourself with something new everyday.',

        content:'The advancing production and technology of the 21st century provided workers with more leisure time to engage in HOBBIES. This has led more people to take up new HOBBIES, soon, they start enjoying and loving their work. Many people may dream of spending less time at work and more time enjoying your pass time.So, How about making your HOBBY as a career? Yes, it is possible to convert your HOBBY into career. Like it is said, “Happy is the man who can make a living by his hobby.” Maybe you can spend time on your HOBBY while you earn a living!It’s pretty obvious to think that I am writing rubbish! But isn’t it mind boggling that most people don’t give consideration to their HOBBIES which they enjoy, when they are deciding what they want to do to make living. Perhaps, it’s because even WEBSTER’S DICTIONARY defines a HOBBY as “a pursuit outside one’s regular occupation.” It’s high time, we should consider changing this definition, because “If you choose to do what you love, you’ll never work a day in your life.” Firstly, identify your interests and research carefully. Many creative careers require some formal trainings, brush up for the new journey. Research your potential audience, determine its pain points and figure out how you can distinguish yourself from competitors. Find your team or start alone, this will never be a problem, because even a little start makes a huge difference. Don’t forget right kind of advertising will get you the right kind of audience, invest your time in proper research and work on it.   Turning your HOBBY into a career might seem daunting, but you can create a successful long- term business with the right strategy, right mentors and right team to work with. A little risk can lead to significant rewards.Just be sure to think carefully about your end goal and follow the path irrespective of however hard it seems in the starting. Keep reminding yourself three things constantly on this path: Why you want to do this?, Are you happy working on your passion? And most important Is this what you really want, the dream you saw? As your mind gives you these answers you will realise you are on the right path. During this pandemic, we saw a lot of businesses coming up on Instagram. These are handled by a single individual, all the stuff from posting to packing orders is done by one single person. Not only business, we saw so many artists coming up with their talent and getting their well deserved fame and audience. What matters is your determination and your efforts to reach your goal, despite of the hurdles on your way. Over the past few years, many individuals and groups have emerged who took the path of their dreams and achieved their end goal. The question arises if they can, why cannot you do it? The difference is they took their first step and found what they really wanted their profession to be, you are still hear finding reasons and way you can convert your HOBBIES into your careers. Come on, it’s time you take your first step and start making your way towards your dreams. ',

        content:'Now-a-days, too much attention is given to “find your passion!” But is it what it is? Do we really need to force ourselves to find our PASSION? Is our life useless if we don’t find our PASSION? These are some questions which crosses everyone’s mind at a point of their life. So, what are the answers to these questions!The answer is NO! All your life you’re told to follow your PASSION, but it is not important to find your PASSION. Yes, that is true. Life is not useless without a PASSION, but life is the journey to explore different fields, find your PASSION and follow it. Expose yourself to different things, dig deep and find out that one thing that makes you ecstatic. People around you may have found their, PASSION that doesn’t mean you are a failure or you need to force yourself to find your PASSION . Manage your anxiety and stress, keep it for future and stop comparing yourself with others. Everyone is unique, with different passions. Many of us are asked what we are passionate about at a very early age. This creates a pressure on us to find our PASSION. I feel PASSION is slightly ridiculous word at an early stage of life, because very few of us know what we’re going to be passionate about at that stage of life. People don’t get hit by a PASSION bolt of lightning, it takes time to develop and nurture. Instead, they fumble, stumble and grumble their way into a whole new world.Forget looking for your PASSION, concentrate more on exploring, exposing and experiencing. Exploring: explore different fields and know more about them to find out which field you are interested in. Exposing: concentrate more on exposing yourself to new interests rather than running behind PASSION.  Experiencing: experience every field and interests to analyse what you really want to do.The reason why most of us don’t start is because, we think we have to be outstanding, or atleast superior in some way in our work. The reality is you’ll never learn something well enough for yourself. You always have to work on upgrading yourself. Instead of asking “how to find my passion?” ask “why do I bother finding my passion?” When you can experience and explore so much, why bother finding your PASSION and making your life complex. Keep it simple and experience every bit of it.When you adopt different approaches to determine what you are interested in, you are slowly moving closer for your t PASSION to discover you. But, being unable to find your PASSION is not your failure by any stretch of the imagination. So, never blame yourself about it. It is always valuable to keep an open mind and incorporation of as many of our interests in our career as possible. There may be hundreds of opportunities out there, but you may have no idea of them. So, it is important to explore fields and gain knowledge about them.So, sit back on your seats and give yourself a break. Don’t chase your PASSION, let your PASSION find you. Till then challenge yourself by learning different skills every new day. And remember, EXPLORE, EXPOSE and EXPERIENCE',
